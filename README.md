This is my code example in Java. eMia is a simple social network. You can register, then post topics with a title, description and a photo.
There are profile editor, push-notification if another user likes your post.
It uses Firebase database, storage, authentication, cloud messages.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 3.0.1

## Introduction

If you want to try eMia, sign in your Google account, then open Firebase console https://console.firebase.google.com
Create a new project. Then follow documentations. As a result you need to download google-services.json file and replace my current file.
