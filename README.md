This is my code example in Java and Kotlin. 
eMia is a simple social network. You can register, then post topics with a title, description and a photo.
There are profile editor, push-notification if another user likes your post, etc.
This used:  
- Firebase database, storage, authentication, cloud messages.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 3.2.1
- Java
- Kotlin 1.3.0
